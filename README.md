Describe your purpose for writing this software.
I wrote this software because it has helped me to learned the key concepts of rust. The fundamentals. it helped me to learn the basics of rust.

Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.
